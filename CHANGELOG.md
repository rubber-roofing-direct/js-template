# Changelog

Thank you for reading the changelog for this repository. Release notes in this repository are automatically generated from commits following the [lightweight commit format](https://github.com/blameitonyourisp/lightweight-commits), and then edited by hand to ensure that they are human readable, and form a logically continuous set of changes. Please see the [changelog notes](#changelog-notes) section at the end of this file for more details on the generation and formatting of release notes in this changelog.

### Table of Contents

## Release Notes

See below for release notes for each relevant version or release in this project. Please note that for convenience, release notes are ordered from most recent release/version *first* to oldest release or version *last*. If no release notes are listed below, then most likely the maintainer(s) of this repository have not yet released a first release or version.

## Changelog Notes

The format of this changelog is based on the guide found at [keep a changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) standards to the best of the ability of the maintainers. Prompts for this changelog are autogenerated using git commits, and release notes are then edited by hand from these prompts.

### Format

Release notes in this changelog follow a specific format in order to maintain consistency. Each release notes section in this changelog will consist of:

1. A heading consisting of:
    1. Tag or semver version number linking to relevant github release
    2. Date of last commit in release or version (i.e. date of last commit before updating the changelog)
    3. Short commit hash of last commit in release or version linking to browse the github repository at that commit
2. A prose summary of the changes made by that release including a bullet point list of release highlights
3. Changes organised by category, edited by hand from prompts generated from commits since last release or version, and consisting of:
    1. Semver change type (breaking change, minor, patch) of change
    2. Summary of change fetched from commit title and edited subsequently
    3. Short commit hash of change linking to browse the github repository at that commit

### Generation

Release notes in this repository are automatically generated from commits following the [lightweight commit format](https://github.com/blameitonyourisp/lightweight-commits), and then edited by hand to ensure that they are human readable, and form a logically continuous set of changes. Each commit since the last changelog entry may generate (depending on type of commit) a release note prompt. This prompt will follow the format indicated in the [format](#format) section above. For more information on changelog generation from commits of a this format please see the [changelog](https://github.com/blameitonyourisp/lightweight-commits#changelog) section of the [lightweight commit format](https://github.com/blameitonyourisp/lightweight-commits) project.

### Categories

Consult the following table for a set of standard categories which may be included in the changelog release notes for a new version or release. Depending on the changes made since the last version or release, some or all of the following categories will be included in the new changelog entry. As with categories from the [keep a changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0) project, changelog categories are past tense version of the imperative mood verbs which would otherwise be used in commit titles. For more information more information on the specific categories used in the changelog release notes of this project, please see the [changelog categories](https://github.com/blameitonyourisp/lightweight-commits#changelog-categories) section of the [lightweight commit format](https://github.com/blameitonyourisp/lightweight-commits) project.

In the following table, the semver column refers to the *most common* minimum [semver](https://semver.org/) version change that will be required by changes in this category, however *any* category may include changes which require *any* minimum [semver](https://semver.org/) version change. In every category, the prompt generated for each commit will also list the minimum [semver](https://semver.org/) version change inferred from the changes made by the given commit. In the case of this table, "feature" may apply to config files, documentation, or any other external or internal feature of the repository.
